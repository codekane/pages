## Why
I made this app in a frenzied few hours on Christmas Eve, 2019. The reason I
made this as an app, instead of doing the graphic design work by hand was due to
the belief that the technologies and learnings I gained from doing it this way
would come in handy for developing the "Future App".

And then I went ahead and made it in Jekyll. So. It cannot do many of the things
I would like it to do, and, frankly, the configurations are such a nightmarishly
contrived thing that I have had great difficulty in refactoring any of the
useful bits out.
