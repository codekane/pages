# Business Description

Spokebooks is a manufacturing company, creating consumer notebooks out of upcycled material, in its present form. The concept is "bespoke notebooks", the idea being to offer consumers, for a comparable price to the leading competitors, an unsurpassed degree of customization of both exterior, as well as interior inclusions/features.

The cover material is scrap vinyl flooring, made directly from manufacturer samples, in its initial form, with the later ability to make use of the scrap vinyl flooring roll material, with the investment into a vinyl cutter. This material is highly durable, water-resistant, offers a unique and engrossing tactile feel, when held in the hands, and can be obtained, presently, for free. This material is likely to otherwise be discarded, and as such, the business is able to capitalize on the buzzword "upcycle" - meaning, essentially, to turn trash into treasures. The sample covers have a hole in them, which I have filled with a 'brass brad', which is aesthetically pleasing, however has left exposed leads on the back. I've tried covering them with a blank mailing label, which sort of works, however I'd like to do better -- especially if I'm to continue using this resource going forward. I would like to seal it in place using a heat-transfer vinyl application of artwork or branding overtop of it, The front/back cover brads are opposite to each other lengthwise, but equivilent widthwise. Holes have been punched on the cut-corner side, because to do so on the opposite side would clip the hole already present, which makes me worry about longevity when threading the coils to refill.



### Corner Cutter

- Weights roughly 20 lbs
- Costs roughly 128 lbs
- 1/4" and 3/8" (R6 and R10) are two most common blades
- Roughly $128 cost for unit
- All viable units are seemingly of Chinese manufacture

### Hole Punch

Punch calibration is still an issue, and product quality/repeatability/consistency will improve slightly when I am able to move to a 16 hole punch. If I can do that successfully with a 3:1 pitch being retained is a further question, and a future switch to a 4:1 pitch may be prudent, though i worry about manually punching the vinyl with that many holes.

Hole punch has been assembled using old heavy-duty commercial, adapted for an 8 punch pattern that is capable of punching either 1 vinyl notebook cover, or 10-15 pages at a time, with each batch requiring 2 punches. Punch is suitable for continuous operation without being clogged if it is re-actuated with no load in it in between every vinyl cover punched. Unknown longevity, however spare parts are on hand, and it is likely to be able to carry forward through to the first $5000 mark of business earnings. At this point, higher-end models might become an option, however I am uncertain about the viability of punching 16 holes in vinyl at once without fucking up the mechanism. Viability of using a Cricut Maker's rotary drill for the cover holes would be a very good avenue to explore.

#### Calibration Notes

- Punch body width is 5/8" (10/16")
- Punch margins are 3/16" left/right
- Hole width is 1/4" (4/17")
- For 3:1 pitch use 3/8" spacing
- 5/8" + 3/8" = 1" offset between punches

For letter size pages

- 4 5/16" - first punch point
- 3 13/16" - second punch point

Train eyeball before beginning to ensure consistent 7/16" margins are produced between teh end holes and the edge of teh page

### Vinyl Cover

Further supplies of vinyl material is not presently a major concern, due to the inabilities to process the materials i already possess (pending maker). I want to talk to the manufacturer direct, perhaps, although contacting other similar local businesses is likely to reveal numerous other leads. I was informed that I can contact Pat Whitehorn in a few months (since October???) to try to secure additional supplies. If I can make good use of the otherwise garbage cover materials, that is perhaps the most environmentally friendly option. I need to search out what I would be paying for this material if paid both at MSRP, as well as what I can find at local discount retailers (end of the roll, reuse center, etc.)

Presently supplies of vinyl flooring are, optimistically, enough for ~350 half-letter sized notebooks, as well as numerous more pocket-sized books (pending design, as well as purchase of suitable perforated paper). The pocketbooks will mimic the format of the 'little black book' i purchased for $5 at the art store near Whyte, however will have covers made of much higher quality materials. Testing using a copper coil has proven insufficiently durable for my own back pocket, however further attempts will be made using the aluminum supplies before bringing to market. 

#### TODO: How do I//can I clean felt?



### Spiral Coils

The coils are presently being made from scrap copper magnet wire, of a gauge between 10 and 18. Maybe one pound of scrap material was suitable for making 10-11 coils, however processing costs were very high on a labour front, and attempts of acquiring more suitable raw material has been unsuccessful. A Chinese supplier that produces aluminum coils has been found, however they require a minimum order quantity of 1,000 units, working out to ~210 Canadian shipped. Each unit is 34 coils, and each notebook requires 16 coils (3:1 pitch), working out to a cost per unit of 11 cents Canadian. Some processing will be required, turning the extra coil into an ornament, however overall costs will be minimized. Current coils are 5/8" diameter, which works with varying success at a 150 page load (higher gauge wire has less room availble for paper). Orders for aluminum coils will aim for 3/4" coils, for expansion capability.

#### Round 1 Production Figures

###### Copper Wire Notes

- 5/8" diameter 39" wire length produces slightly more than one 16 run noteook
- 6/8" diameter 40" wire length produces 14 rings
- 120" wire length produces 35 1" rings, 45 6/8" ring
- 12 rings 1" diameter = 19 rings 5/8" diameter
- 16 rings 1" diameter = 27 rings 5/8" diameter
- 40 rings 1" diameter =57 rings 5/8" diameter
- 1" diameter coil with 39" wire length produces 11 rings
- 1" diameter coil with 51" of wire length produces 16 rings
- 7/8" diameter coil with 46 1/3" wire length produces 16 rings
- 6/8" diameter coil with 45" wire length produces 16 rings
- 125" wire length produces 43 rings 7/8" coil
- 5/8" diamter coils are aceptable for bidning together a 100 page notebook

I've crafted and installed coils on four different styles of notebooks. The aestheticals are great, the weight is immense, the labour involved is significantly, and hardly profitable. 

- 1 score of scrap magnet wire (maybe 1 lb) provided enough raw material for ~12 half-letter size notebook
- Thick wire requries a larger coil diameter to compensate, in order to contain the same number of pages as a smaller diameter wire coil

##### Final Bookbinding//Finishing

- 7.5 minutes on average to straighten and coil a suitable length of copper
- 3 minutes on average to elongate a sraightened coil
- 6 minutes on average to finish coils
- ~ 15 minutes to produce 1 spiral coil
- At $30/hr time value this means each spiral coil costs $7.50 to produce and finish.
- Unable to secure additional copper resources





#### Costs to acquire instead of produces

- mybinding.com sells a 3 pack of 'Carl 18mm Gray Steel 3:1 spiral wire coil) for $4.69 USD. These coils are long enough for 2 16 coil bindings each, resulting in a cost per unit of $0.78 USD ($1.03 CAD)





#### TODO: Find suitable faculties for laboratory analysis of Chinese coils to ascertain the presencee of heavy metals

#### TODO: Consider grinding a blunt edge onto the insertion point of the coil, so as to spare the cover from trauma, and cease being a danger to children

### Paper

Replacement paper supplies need to be a thing. The concept here is based upon a reusable notebook, and given teh lack of erasable pages (aka Rocketbook) I need to be able to provide cost-effective replacement pages. I can print them myself, most likely, however shipping costs are as of yet a mystery. In my head i am imagining a web app where people can design their own page load, based upon a stable of options, which is then either printed on-site and dispatched, or else dispatched to a partnered print shop, or provided in raw pdf format with specific instructions as to how to produce it which is suitable to give to any print shop. I don't know yet if they can cater to that request, or how much it will cost.

#### TODO: Paper Sourcing Costs Table

#### Inner/Outer Covers

Thoughts include using recycled plastic half-letter as inner/outer liners, to prevent the density of the felt from adversely impacting writing performance. 

Use of cardstock is also an option, and would enable to print on the thick cover, as well as have the 'in case found' page on the back of the title page.

### Heat Press

- Needed for Vinyl kerjiggering
- Cricut Easypress is an option, but not very big, or necessarily multi-purpose
- http://unclewiener.com/product/new-5-in-1-heat-press-swing-away-machine-sublimation-hat-mug-hp5in1h/

### Paper Cutting

Paper cutting is presently accomplished by going to staples, or using a razor blade. This is shit, and Staples isn't close enough for it to be a viable option for serious production entures. Additionally, their cutter is only capable of 5 pages at a time before the cuts are no longer clean. Most guillotine-style cutters seem capable of 15 pages at a time, making 1 notebook of 150 pages take only 5 operations of the paper cutter. Paper cutting is best done in batch processes, minimizing context switches. I need to buy a paper cutter.

Paper has been presently handled using a stock of old dot-matrix paper, which, while labour intensive, has provided me with the initial stock of 2,000 pages. I'm nearly through half of that, some of it having been used for blank pages for the initial mock-ups, and others in printing the business planning book, as well as test pages for the page layout. I do not know what consumers want for paper. The current stock is 50% recycled, kinda browned on the edges, and of unknown restockability, however I find it quite nice to write with, and it gives the books a nice, aged feel to them, in addition to the copper.

- http://unclewiener.com/product/new-12-inch-a4-paper-cutter-guillotine-trimmer-cutting-machine-4qzj/ $160 (pretty spiffy)

### Page Design//Layout

The interior pages, in the initial offeringo, are relatively standard dot grid and lined pages. The mechanisms/technologies I am using to create these pages, however (standard web technologies) offer me the opportunity to later expand upon these concepts. A possible direction the company may take, going into the future, is to target the "smart notebook" market

#### Smart Notebook

Smart notebook premise is to first gather data on user habits, patterns, and actual pages, to get a better idea of just what kind of information they are tracking. Then, to design pages that use the planning apparatus they themselves have drawn (dotgrid only) and re-create it using HTML, and CSS. Then comes the big stuff. Use an OCR algorithm to (RELIABLY!!!!) pull structured, machine-clean-data from the charts, calenders, and whatnot. THEN, we feed it into app integrations. Same basic idea as the Rocketbook, except instead of just uploading images, which at best use Evernote's OCR search algorithm, we instead auto-magically update the users google (or whomever) calendar with what they just wrote in on their paper calender. This could go much further, and a thorough study of the current utilization of the technologies found in enterprise level CRM software is warranted. This is a very late stage of the game, and it's likely to require hiring in outside help. Call it Phase IV.

### Printing

Production of the interior pages is done using an at-home Brother B&W laser printer. It's 50,000 pages per month duty cycle (100,000 actual, half-letter) is capable of producing 1,000 units per month (assuming 100 pages per notebook sold). This printer features a 0.17in margin on all sides when using the borderless setting, which, with proper page design, is virtually invisible to the end user.

Colour print faculties are presently inaccessible. Use of a consumer-grade ink-tank printer is an option, however uncertain as to whether my production capabilities can presently justify.

###### TODO: Contact local print shops to get quotes on how much they would charge to produce the pages as required

###### TODO: Compile price points of replacement ink, drum, for both manufacturer as well as refilled units.

### Production Capacity

Initial production capability will be of only 10 units. I've already processed the blanks

### Production Facilities

Presently my closet is sufficient to store all material hence acquired. I can setup in Arinna's garage, and my laser printer is in my room. Future expansion is big unknown...

### Heat Transfer Vinyls

Use of Heat-Transfer-Vinyl technologies, made possible with the investment/acquisition in a Cricut Maker. This will enable collaboration with (select?) artists to have their work featured on the covers of the notebook. 



### Airbrushing

#### TODO: Investigate Airbrushing the felt as an option to spice things up

## The Opportunity

Bullet notebooking/bullet journalling is the buzzword. The onus is equipping people to better manage their lives, keep track of their notes, and, ultimately, find success in whatever it is they choose to do. There are a plethora of online note-keeping apps (Microsoft OneNote, Dropbox, Evernote immediately spring to mind) that are widely disseminated and successful, as well as many, many others that see various degrees of success. The opportunity is that I have tried to make use out of all of these services, as well as worked to invent my own "paper-based" system, and I think I can do it better than anyone has yet done it.

> Look into Microsoft OneNote and what it offers

> Look into Dropbox and what it offers

> Look at Evernote and what it offers

Looking at the currently available paper-based notebooks on offer, I do not feel they've kept pace, or truly innovated. There are a plethora of offerings out there **literally every living human on this planet who has gone to school has used a notebook**, however there's been no true innovation in the field. The holy grail of consumer notebooks right now, ignoring smart notebooks, for this moment, happens to be a Moleskine with 1/4" dot grid. That's an oversimplification, however that's what I've always seen as the benchmark for "the best notebook, the one you'd spend $20 buying".

For starters, it fills up. What do you do when your notebook is full? Buy another one? And lose easy access to everything you had noted down? Try to hold onto it, stuffing the back pouch pocket with extra paper, until you find yourself so disorganized that you lose the damned thing? It's a wonderful item, however when your notes are pertaining to more than a single topic, and you're writing down important bits of information, the current status quo is woefully inadequate at solving the aforementioned problems. It just plain sucks. 

You've basically got a bound book that isn't ready to be bound yet. That's all that notebooks are, storing houses for information that has yet to be compiled into something worth reading (for more than just you). What I am proposing to do is to create and market a re-usable/re-fillable notebook, using a spiral-bound coil to enable users to re-order, re-fill, and re-use it, combined with an online system enabling them to order replacement sheets, either from us, or by our partnership with print shops (who can be proven to produce our product when provided with pdf's and specifications). This can be done economically, I feel, with an upgraded notebook likely being possible to produce at any print shop for a mere $5, including binding their old pages into a slightly-less-durable cover. I know I can do the printing for $5, at least...



Refillable notebooks simply aren't a thing. I want to know why they aren't a thing. Is it too much for most people's brains to handle? Possibly. This will need to be tested. There are companies that offer refill pages for their "planners" (distinct market with a near-identical product). There are people doing it... But I haven't appreciated the designs of any planners I've used, filled with non-reusable/non-repurposable/non-multifunctional UI elements, which ultimately lead to a large portion of a wasted page in much of the book, and an expiry date built into the product. That's no good.



### Opportunity #1

- A notebook with a uniquely tactile cover of unmatched versatility, utilizing upcycled scrap vinyl flooring samples and rolls.

### Opportunity #2

A means of making a truly customizable notebook experience, utilizing various technologies and artistries to allow users to further customize the appearance of their notebook. This can include such things as heat-transfer-vinyl lettering on the covers, artwork on the inner covers, as well as the ability to truly customize the inner workings of their notebook.

### Opportunity #3

A means of economically refilling the notebook, providing the user a means to efficiently archive the previously used pages, order replacement pages economically, and perhaps even to wholly customize the books they ordered (instead of buying a blank notebook, they can use us as a publishing service, economically(?????)).

### Opportunity #4

A one-size-fits-all index/organization system, made to be simple enough for most people to wrap their heads around, yet sufficiently strong (backed, perhaps, by an intelligent application utilizing per-page-metadata) so as to render the process largely painless. 

### Opportunity #5

I can re-sell the bulk materials I purchase overseas on Amazon, or otherwise dometically, to potentially recoup some costs.

## The REAL Opportunity. Pain Point. Mission Statement

To build a two-way bridge between Analog and Digital records-keeping systems for the average consumers, enabling them to make use of their handwritten calenders, plans, notes, records, drawings, logs, doodles, sketches, etc. easily and painlessly in a variety of digital formats, as well as to convert all of this data from the digital realm back into a paper format (so you have a calender, you write in the calender, you take a picture, it updates your google calender. Then you can print out your google calender records into the same format, all in the app, and have basically your permanent record of what you did, in book form, for safe-keeping and perusal away from the distractions inherent to the digital age.)

## Strengths

- Scrap vinyl flooring is a forgiving, durable, and (presently) free resource that will enable me to bring my business to the point of making a profit sooner than if I had to buy the material at MSRP (likely never if I bought it for full price)
- Everyone needs a notebook, and I know enough people to market it solely to them and, likely, break-even on required investments **PROVE IT**
- I have experience working with government records, reverse-engineering various iterations of organizational systems.
- My notebooks are refillable. This means I'll know if the concept is sound, because people will be repeating customers.
- Blog posts concerning the making of the notebooks, including the bits I scrap from finaly production iterations, but that are udner-represented in teh google searches I used to attempt to find out how to do it (spiral coil making, for example) will constitute organic SEO
- Wealth of artistry in my life to provide me with ideas on how to is better refine the concepts I am working iwth, and make something both functional, beautiful, and truly great.
- First 50 sales on the Shopify platform using a site built with my Developer account are free, with no mongthly fee.
- Enough free paper to support experimentation on page design concepts
- Support from successful entrepreneurs who can help guide me
- Custom made page templates means I can produce very high-quality, customized pages, with the possibility to present a personally-imbued notebook taht is quite unmatched on the market.
- 



## Weaknesses

- Online purchasers will have difficulty appreciating the tactility of the product before purchasing it
- Recycled paper is of unknown appeal to my target market (who is my target market?)
- Unproven concepts on all fronts
- Frankenstein punch is optimized as far as I can take it, and until I can afford to upgrade to a better unit it will produce hole spacings with a human margin of error
- Covers are soft and pliable, and quite giving iwth regards to the force exerted by a pen/pencil, which may not be nice to use.
- Bad smell (vinyl off-gassing)



## Initial Product Offering

I am offering a 6" wide, 8.5" tall, thick, visually attractive, and interestingly tactile upcycled, refillable, spiral bound notebook. I offer customizable covers and formatting of the interior pages (initially in black and white only), as well as the option to economically purchase replacement pages. The paper inside is 50% recycled, and the spiral coil is made out of scrap copper magnet wire (converting to Chinese aluminium for offical launch). The initial pages offered on launch include 1/4" dot grid, lined, and blank, with the option of inscribing a name onto each page, as well as numbering the pages, and providing the option to include an index, so as to facilitate an easier to transition to a bullet journalling system.

## Solved Problems

- Frankenstein punch
- Spiral coil crafting
- Sources for economical aluminum spiral coils
- Consistent punch margins

## Unsolved Problems

- Online kanban board to track ideas
- Sell a single notebook
- Create $20 of value
- Find artists to wokr with
- Make the felt backing less ugly
- Heat transfer vinyl
- Power cord for Silhouette
- Vinyl cutting
- Social Media Presence
- Product Photos
- Etsy listings

## Possible Expenses

- Better, more reliable laptop
- Upgraded laptop RAM and SSD
- Paper

- Transition to 4:1 pitch(?????)
- Printer Toner
- Perforated paper to produce pocket notebooks
- Blog post authoring
- Logo design
- Incorporation of business (expensive)
- Business bank account

## Brand Building

I started this journey a few years ago, when I started to regularly keep a notebook. What I kept in it varied, what it looked like would always change, but the thing that stayed the same was that it meant having a small slice of sanity with me at all times.

Now, as the years have gone by, I've been through a number of different formats, styles, and my writing abilities have progressed
